    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do is initiate a repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this with `git init`command in the folder that you would like to track the changes in. The biggest recommendation is\n",
    "to not initialize in a home folder but rather the project folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have types in the command it will create the necessary folders in the root of the folder and it will manage the\n",
    "version control of the folder for all future files.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also initialize a repository in a folder that already has files, all that will happen here\n",

    "\n",
    " - Local area - The local view of the files\n",
