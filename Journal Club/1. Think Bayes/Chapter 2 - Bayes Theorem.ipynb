    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the previous chapter we derived Bayes Theorem, Seeing as we had a dataset with the population data there was no purpose in us using the theorem as we already had all the information we needed.\n",
    "- in the previous chapter it was easy enough calculate the left side:\n",
    "$$P(A|B)$$\n",
    "than the right:\n",
    "$$\\frac{P(A)P(B|A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "As we already had data to calculate the values.\n",
    "- But often we dont have the complete data set so this is when Bayes Theorem is more useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Cookie Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the first examples we will look at is a thin version of the `Urn Problem`:\n",
    "    - Suppose there are two bowls of Cookies:\n",
    "        - Bowl 1 contains 30 Vanilla Cookies and 10 Chocolate Cookies\n",
    "        - Bowl 2 contains 20 Vanilla Cookes and 20 Chocolate Cookies\n",
    "    - Now suppose that you pick a Bowl at random and without looking take a cookie from the Bowl.\n",
    "    - If the cookie is vanilla what is the probability that it came from Bowl 1?\n",
    "    - In Mathamatical terms it is `P(B1|V)` or what is the conditional probability of picking Bowl 1 given that we have a Vanilla Cookie.\n",
    "- From the original description of the problem we have the following informaiton:\n",
    "    - The conditional probability of getting a Vanilla cookie given Bowl 1 `P(V|B1)`\n",
    "    - The conditional probability of getting a Vanilla Cookie given Bowl 2 `P(v|B2)`.\n",
    "- These are both pieces of information that is not required in answering the question but using Bayes Theorem we can calculate the Conditional Probability using the inverse Conditional Probability.\n",
    "- Looking back at the problem we have the following:\n",
    "    - The Probability of picking Bowl 1 `P(B1)` which is 0.5 as there are two and we pick one at random(This is an assumption on our side).\n",
    "    - The Probability of getting a Vanilla Cookie Given Bowl 1 `P(V|B1)` which is 0.75 (Based on what we have been given).\n",
    "    - The Probability of getting a Vanilla Cookie Given Bowl 2 `P(V|B2)` which is 0.5 (Based on what we have been given).\n",
    "    - The Probability of getting a Vanilla Cookie from either Bowl `P(V)`.\n",
    "- To calculate `P(V)` we can use the law of total probability:\n",
    "$$P(V) = P(B_1)P(V|B_1) + P(B_2)P(V|B_2)$$\n",
    "$$= (0.5)(0.75) + (0.5)(0.5) = \\frac{5}{8}$$\n",
    "- We could have also calculated the result directly because:\n",
    "    - Since the bowls have an equal chance of being picked and there is equal cookies in each jar means there is an equal chance of selecting a cookie.\n",
    "    - Between the two Bowls we have 50 Vanilla Cookies and 30 Chocolate ones which is the 5/8.\n",
    "- Finally we will apply Bayes Theorem and solve the problem:\n",
    "$$P(B_1|V) = \\frac{(\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{3}{4})}{\\frac{5}{8}} = \\frac{3}{5}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diachronic Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is another way of thinking about Bayes Theorem, it gives us a way to update the probability of a hypothesis , `H`, given some body of data `D`.\n",
    "- This interpretation is Diachronic, which means changing over time.\n",
    "- We can now Supstitute the New variables into Bayes Theorem to look like the following:\n",
    "$$P(H|D) = \\frac{P(H)P(D|H)}{P(D)} $$\n",
    "- In this interpretation we name the following:\n",
    "    - `P(H)` is the probability of the hypothesis before we see the body of data, Also called the Prior Probability or just Prior.\n",
    "    - `P(H|D)` is the probability of the hypothesis after we have seen the data. Called the Posterior.\n",
    "    - `P(D|H)` is the probability of the data under the hypothesis called the likelihood.\n",
    "    - `P(D)` is the total probability of the data, under any hypothesis.\n",
    "- Sometimes the Prior can be calculated with the information givern for instance the Cookie problem gives us the Bowls with the cookie probabilites.\n",
    "- In other cases the Prior can be subjective and reasonable people may disagree on the value we should set for this value.\n",
    "- The Likelihood is usually the easiest part to calculate, In the cookie Bowl problem we were given the number of cookies in the Bowl and we could calculate the probability of each cookie in each Bowl.\n",
    "- Computing the total probability of the data can be tricky, it is supposed to be the probability of the data under any hypothesis at all.\n",
    "- Most often we simplify things by specifying a set of hypothesis that are:\n",
    "    - Mutually exclusive.\n",
    "    - Collectively Exhaustive, The correct solution must be in the set.\n",
    "- When these conditions apply we can calculate the Total Probability with the following:\n",
    "$$P(D) = P(H_1)(P(D|H_1) + P(H_2)P(D|H_2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bayes Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "- A convienent tool to doing a Bayesian update is Bayes Tables. You can write Bayes Tables on Paper or do it in Python.\n",
    "- We will first make an empty DataFrame\n"
